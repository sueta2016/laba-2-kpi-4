# Lab 2 Martynenko Oleh and Nilita Nesterov IM-11

About commits: we did this work using tool for collaborative programming (LiveShare) from Nikita's laptop, so in Oleh's commits he displays like collaborator, because of git config on Nikita's laptop

Firstly you need to install Node.js and npm. You can do it by following this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Use version 14 or higher.

To run the program, you need to enter the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sueta2016/laba-2-kpi-4/
cd laba-2-kpi-4
npm i
npm start
```
Then you can change the input file with your own content and run the program again.
```bash
npm start
```
To run tests use this command:
```bash
npm test
```
This command also generates a coverage report in the coverage folder. And you can also see coverage report in the terminal.
Now it says that the coverage is 100%.

Result of the game you can see in output.txt file.
```bash
cat output.txt
```
